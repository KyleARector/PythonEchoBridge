# Python Echo Bridge
This project is inspired by armzilla's [amazon-echo-ha-bridge.](https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge)

It is intended to provide UPnP and API resources to allow Amazon Echo to discover the server and map devices to commands. 

Right now, it is configured for our SmartHome set up, but could be used to integrate with other systems.

# Features 
- Automatic discovery via UPnP
