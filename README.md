# Python Echo Bridge
This project is inspired by armzilla's [amazon-echo-ha-bridge.](https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge)

It is intended to provide UPnP and API resources to allow Amazon Echo to discover the server and map devices to commands. 

Right now, it is configured for our [SmartHome](https://github.com/KyleARector/SmartHome) set up, but could be used to integrate with other systems.

# Features 
- Automatic discovery via UPnP
- API for Echo to control lights

# To Do
- API refinement
- Allow variable dimming with Echo
